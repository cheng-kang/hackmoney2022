# ENS Layer2 Support - hackmoney2022

This project implements ENS Layer2 Support outlined in [ENS Layer2 and offchain data support](https://docs.ens.domains/dapp-developer-guide/ens-l2-offchain) with [zkSync](https://zksync.io/).

L1 contract is deployed on [GÃ¶rli Testnet](https://goerli.net/). Gateway is hosted with GCP. L2 contracts are deployed on [zkSync v2.0](https://v2-docs.zksync.io/dev/testnet/metamask.html).

- L1 Offchain Resolver: 0xF9CF7Bf515DB6657A632d185ae9B8A1643004496
- Gateway: https://gateway.pps.onl
- L2 Public Resolver: 0x59dEFA8B25aC6DcD393507DE486C8E4835d945b3
- L2 Public Registry: 0x4C8feDB7F0EF9337DADEb55fFb41Da763f357f6e

## Usage

Any ENS second-level domain (e.g. pps.eth) owners can choose to migrate into the L2 Public Registry & Resolver by:

1. set resolver of the second-level domain to **L1 Offchain Resolver: 0xF9CF7Bf515DB6657A632d185ae9B8A1643004496**
2. use the `moveIn` method provided by the L2 Public Registry to setup ownership for ENS records update on L2

## Demo

For demo purpose, we've migrated `pps.eth` to `L1 Offchain Resolver`. We've also set a few ENS records with `L2 Public Resolver` for `3n4.pps.eth`. You can check the records live on: https://app.ens.domains/name/3n4.pps.eth/details
